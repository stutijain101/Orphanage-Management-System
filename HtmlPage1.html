                            First you need to come to Jaipur. You will find direct bus to Helping Hands in Sindhi camp. You can even board an auto rickshaw or a cab and ask the driver to come directly to Helping Hands.

                            The preferred time for visitors to meet children in Helping Hands would be from 11am to 6pm. Make sure you have your adhar card and pan card with you while you are visiting. If you have a criminal record you won't be allowed to see the children. It is better to contact us ahead of time so that your time is not wasted.

                            We are very selective in who we choose as volunteers to look after children. We don't let them become a permanent volunteer unless the senior volunteers are assured that they have the knack to do their job. They are very nurturing and friendly towards the children. We also make sure to give the children good food and education. We try our best to maintain cleanliness and the hygiene. You can always come and give us a visit if this answer is not able to satisfy you.

                            After you have been issued a token, you need to manually visit Helping Hands on the date specified. Give us a call beforehand for your convenience. Bring your adhaar card, Pan card, driving license, marriage certificate, salary slips of past 3 months, income certificate, health certificate. We will then ask you a few questions and tell you about all the legal proceedings.

If you think you have met all the criterias listed in adoption page of our website then feel free to write an email to us asking about the same. You can also give us a call.

                            Sponsorship is a way to help the orphans without adopting them. It means that you can take care of their expenses such as education, clothes and so on. It would be a great help for children.

                            It depends on how long you want to sponsor the child. We do recommend to sponsor them for at least an year. If you wish, you can sponsor them till they get independent or till someone adopts the child.

                            You can provide them for as long as you want. You can quit whenever you like and you can join whenever you like. We would highly appreciate if you could complete whatever you are teaching. Eg: If you are teaching the basics of singing then it would be wonderful if you finish teaching the basics. Leaving it midway would be bad.

                            It depends on your convenience. However, we do recommend that you at least provide the class for 30 minutes. The longest duration would ideally be 1.5 hrs because that is how much a human brain can compensate.

                        Are there any special documents I need to have when I manually visit the orphanage?

                            You must carry your aadhar card with you. It would be more convenient if you can bring your certificate, pan card and if you have experience tecahing/working in that field then bring documents related to do that.

                        Is there any age restriction on who can provide hobby classes?

                        <p>
                            The ideal age for providing hobby classes would be 18 and above. If you are below 18 then you would still be considered. However, we might not approve if you are less than 16 years old.
